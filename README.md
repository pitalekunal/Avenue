Test

1. The Project is a Selenium - cucumber based page object framework, it is a demonstration of 
how pageobject framework can be made with cucumber.

2. The Project consists of src folder which has the runnable source with the Test Steps and Test Runner files.

3. There are pageObjectMethod and pageObject packages which are used primarily to give you an idea about the frameworks architecture.

4. Feature folder consists of the user features in gherkin syntax.

5. Build.xml is the ant file and will give you an idea about the jars used.

I did not have enough time to extend the framework to all the steps in Test Stpes class but I have given an example of Login page,
as to how a page object framework can be built from an architecture point.
